# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# 62.times do |i|
#   blog_post = BlogPost.where(title: "Blog Post #{i + 1}").first_or_initialize
#   blog_post.update(content: "This is the content for Blog Post #{i + 1}, published_at: Time.current - #{i} days") if blog_post.new_record?
#   blog_post.save!
